# 🔢 Sudoku Solver

This project implements an efficient and reliable **Sudoku solver** using a recursive backtracking algorithm in C++. It can solve even complex Sudoku puzzles with high accuracy and optimized performance.

---

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ **Recursive backtracking** algorithm to solve standard 9x9 Sudoku grids
- ⚡ **Optimized search** to reduce the number of backtracking steps
- 🧠 Solves difficult puzzles efficiently by applying constraint propagation and logical placement
- 🛠️ Easy-to-read, modular code with reusable functions and classes

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Language**: C++
- **Concepts**: Backtracking, Recursion, Constraint Satisfaction
- **Libraries**: Standard Template Library (STL)
